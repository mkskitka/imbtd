In recent years, “immersive digital experiences” have gained widespread popularity, from commercial exhibits like Van Gogh: The Immersive Experience to museums adapting spaces for digital art and brands leveraging interactive installations for promotion. But are these experiences truly immersive, and how can we evaluate them? 
Immersivity Beyond the Display delves into the design of visual, interactive installations. Each week, students will modify existing sketches in p5.js to explore immersive design principles while building on foundational programming skills. “Demo days” will provide opportunities to test and reflect on each other’s prototypes. We will focus on narrative development, embodiment, social and emotional engagement and interaction mechanics to frame our exploration.  Weekly exercises will be enriched with relevant readings and discussions. By the end of the class, students will have developed their own model for evaluating immersivity in interactive digital experiences.
Prerequisite: Students should have completed Creative Computing or possess equivalent coding experience with p5.js and JavaScript.
